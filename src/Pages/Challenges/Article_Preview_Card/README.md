## My process

### Built with

- Vue.js
- Tailwind CSS (Flex & Grid)
- Google Fonts
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue3 Popper](https://github.com/valgeirb/vue3-popper) - A Vue.js popover component based on PopperJS
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to add a color to an inline svg icon in tailwind css using the `fill-{color}` property

### Useful resources

- [Vue3 Popper](https://github.com/valgeirb/vue3-popper) - This helped me with the popper on medium+ screens
- [Tailwind Transition](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-duration) - Used this property in setting the duration
  at which the share button background transitions in and out
